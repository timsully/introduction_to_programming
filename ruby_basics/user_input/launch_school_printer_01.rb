=begin
Write a program that prints 'Launch School is the best!' repeatedly until 
a certain number of lines have been printed. The program should obtain the
number of lines from the user, and should insist that at least 3 lines are printed.

For now, just use #to_i to convert the input value to an Integer, and check that
result instead of trying to insist on a valid number; validation of numeric input
is a topic with a fair number of edge conditions that are beyond the scope 
of this exercise.
