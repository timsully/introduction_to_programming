Using the following code, compare the value of name with the string "RoGeR"
while ignoring the case of both strings. Print true if the values are the 
same; print false if they aren't. Then, perform the same case-insensitive 
comparison, except compare the value of name with the string 'DAVE' instead
of 'RoGeR'
