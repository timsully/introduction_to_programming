=begin
The variables below are both assigned to arrays. The first one, names, contains 
a list of names. The second one, activities, contains a list of activites. Write
the methods name and activity so that they each take the appropiate array and
return a random value from it. Then write the method sentence that combines both
values into a sentence and returns it from the method.

Example output:
George went walking today!
=end
names = ['Dave', 'Sally', 'George', 'Jessica']
activities = ['walking', 'running', 'cycling']

def name(arr)
  # take names array
end

def activities(array)
  # take names array
end

def sentence(one, two)
  # Combines both values into a sentence and returns it from the method
end

puts sentence(name(names), activity(activities))
