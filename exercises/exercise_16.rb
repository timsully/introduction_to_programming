Take the following array:

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word.
Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.
=end

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice', 'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
