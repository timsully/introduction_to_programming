Voight-Kampff gem is a Ruby gem that detects bots, 
spiders, crawlers and replicants. Easily detects 
a request and if it's coming from a crawler, spider, etc.
Helpful in analytics such as page hit tracking.

I personally like this because it has to do with detecting
automated bots and bots are what got me into programming
in the first place thanks to design tools. BOOSH! SPAGAT!
