=begin
In exercise 12, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one.
Now, programatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise
12, and populate the associated data form the contact_data array. Hint:
You will probably need to iterate over( [:email, :address, :phone] ), and
some helpful methods might be the Array shift and first methods.

Note that this exercise is ony concerned with dealing with 1 entry in the 
contacts hash, like this:

contact_data = ["joe@email.com", "123 Main St.", "555-123-4567"]
contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}}

As a bonus, see if you can figure out how to make it work with multiple
entries in the contacts hash.
